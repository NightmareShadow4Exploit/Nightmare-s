<h3>Lineage and Upbringing:</h3>
<img src="images/imam hasan and imam hussain with holy prophet s.a.w.jfif" alt="Desert Landscape" class="right-image">
<p>Imam Husain ibn Ali was born in 626 AD, the second son of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad.

<img src="images/makkah to karbala.jpg" alt="Desert Landscape" class="left-image">
<p>   The tragedy of Karbala unfolded against the backdrop of a power struggle within the Muslim community following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD. Imam Husain found himself at the center of this tumultuous period as tensions escalated between the ruling Umayyad dynasty and supporters of the Prophet's family.</p>
<p>   In 680 AD, Imam Husain received numerous appeals for help from the people of Kufa (in present-day Iraq) who sought to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the Umayyad caliph, Yazid ibn Muawiya. Responding to their pleas, Imam Husain, along with his family and companions, embarked on a journey to Kufa. However, upon reaching Karbala, they were intercepted by Yazid's forces.</p>
<br>

<h3>The Tragedy of Karbala:</h3>

<p>Imam Husain, despite being vastly outnumbered, refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid, choosing instead to uphold the principles of justice and dignity. On the 10th of Muharram, known as Ashura, Imam Husain and his followers faced a brutal onslaught from Yazid's army. Despite enduring thirst, hunger, and relentless attacks, Imam Husain and his loyal companions remained steadfast in their commitment to truth and righteousness.</p>
